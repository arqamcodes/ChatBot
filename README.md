# ChatBot

Excited to share my latest project! ðŸŽ‰ Iâ€™ve developed an AI-based chatbot designed to assist users with all their university admission-related queries to get admission in Dawood University of Engineering and Technology. This innovative tool leverages the powerful Gemini API to provide accurate and personalized responses, ensuring prospective students get the information they need quickly and efficiently.

Built using Python, the chatbotâ€™s user interface is crafted with Tkinter, creating a seamless and intuitive user experience. By incorporating cutting-edge generative AI libraries, the chatbot can deliver precise and contextually relevant answers, enhancing the overall interaction and support for users. However, itâ€™s important to note that while the chatbot aims to provide accurate information, it retrieves data from the web and may not always display the most current or precise details.

This project aims to streamline the admission process, making it easier for students to navigate the complexities of university admissions. Iâ€™m looking forward to seeing how this technology can improve our university's outreach and support, making a positive impact on prospective students' journeys <3
